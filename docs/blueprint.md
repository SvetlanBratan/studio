# **App Name**: Magic Duel Assistant

## Core Features:

- Character Sheet Display: Display character information clearly at the start of the duel, including race, reserve, elemental knowledge, faith level, physical condition, bonuses/penalties, and inventory. 
- Duel Log Input: Provide an input form for the duel log using the specified 'Hod' template with fields for penalties, bonuses, passive effects, actions taken (with OM/OD costs), and resulting OZ/OM/OD totals.
- Stat Calculation: Implement automatic calculation of OZ, OM, and OD based on actions taken and passive effects, alerting the user to invalid actions (e.g., insufficient OM/OD).
- Real-Time Stat Tracking: Display updated OZ/OM/OD for both players in real-time to reflect current states and make tracking easier. Visual representation with bars/meters of these stats are useful.
- Action Suggestion Tool: Provide AI-powered suggestions for possible actions (spells, movements, item usage) based on current stats, opponent information, and known game rules; the suggestions must include accurate cost estimates and effects. Act as a tool to improve strategy.
- Dice Rolling: Handle all dice rolls that are part of the rule-set, to resolve mechanics of Faith checks or Familiars attacks.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#4B0082) to evoke a sense of magic and mystery.
- Background color: Light Gray (#D3D3D3) to ensure readability and reduce eye strain during long sessions.
- Accent color: Electric Purple (#BF00FF) for interactive elements and highlighting key information. This analogous color to the primary color will add contrast.
- Body and headline font: 'Literata', serif. For a classic fantasy aesthetic.
- Use icons representing different magic schools, status effects, and item types.
- Design a split-screen layout, with the current state of duel participants (HP, Mana, Penalties, bonuses, equipment, description) on the left side of the screen and the input log section on the right.
- Use subtle animations for damage display, stat changes, and spell effects. Animations must follow the speed of text on-screen, and have a tactile component.
